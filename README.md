Image Segmentation with Machine Learning
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.

I'm using the Mask R-CNN architecture to perform image segmentation. It is an extension of the Faster R-CNN Model which is preferred for object detection tasks.
